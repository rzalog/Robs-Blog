Programming post about using C++ to solve technical questions:
- Going over the STL, what type of data structure each represents
- Show how to use the often nasty syntax for using each data structure
	* for example, declaring an unordered_set that maps from an int to a vector - that's a mess!

Programming post about data structures in general to be used:
- ex., What is a hashmap and when is it useful
- Probably more on why/when things are useful, rather than explaining what the data structure is
