My name is Robert Zalog. This is my blog. I could tell you a lot more about myself, and why I am writing things on to the internet, but that would probably be better explained in my [introduction post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-04-18-introduction %}).

Now here is a gigantic picture of me giving my best fake smile in my most professional outfit that I had hoped would impress those looking at my LinkedIn, and perhaps will impress you (don't worry, I'm not getting my hopes up).
